# SpaceExplorer
Space Explorer was originally an idea that took significant inspiration from the popular game, Faster than Light.
This project was coded through the Lazarus engine using Pascal and took around two months to reach its current functionality.
Unfortunately, after working through this project for a significant portion of time, I found that the Lazarus engine had some limitations that prevented the project from reaching its full potential/fulfilling its scope. Hence, work on this game has ceased since.
